CVE-2021-4034:
- ''
- A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility.
  The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to
  run commands as privileged users according predefined policies. The current version
  of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying
  to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting
  environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code.
  When successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given
  unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.
